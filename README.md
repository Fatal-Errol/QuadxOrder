Fatal-Errol/QuadxOrder
=======

Created by Errol A. Zu√±iga Jr.

Introduction
------------

This is a prototype designed to fetch and display the order data provided by QuadX API.

Everything here is written from scratch. Guzzle is the only third party library used.

A simple MVC framework was made just to show the developer's level of understanding on the subject. The task can be achived with minimal and procedural type of code but the developer decided on this approach to showcase his skills.

2. Initialize dependencies by running "composer install"
3. Run "php index.php" from the project directory
